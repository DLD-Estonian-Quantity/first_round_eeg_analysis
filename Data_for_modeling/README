In this folder, we provide the dataset utilized for constructing linear mixed models (LMM), simple linear regression models (SLRM), and generalized additive mixed models (GAMM). The abbreviations used in the file names are defined as follows:

LMM: Linear Mixed Model
SLRM: Simple Linear Regression Model
stShortSada: Data from the standard waveform under the short "sada" Q1 condition
devShortSada: Data from the deviant waveform in the short "sada" Q1 condition
MMR: Data representing the deviant-minus-standard difference at the early time window
LDN: Data representing the deviant-minus-standard difference at the late time window
For files labeled LMM, the mean values for all available trials are presented. In contrast, SLRM files present one mean value per participant, calculated across all available trials.

Significant time windows and electrodes used in these analyses were selected based on principal component (PC) analysis and the results of cluster-based permutation tests.

Files with names containing 'Rcode' are (.R) files that document the modeling process.
